## Research Question
### What kind of impact did the pandemic have on the electricity/energy consumption and costs for NYCHA properties?
- Research Focus:
The goal of this analysis is to understand the trends in electricity consumption and costs across the five boroughs of New York City over the various phases of the pandemic.

## Description of the Notebook
### In this Jupyter Notebook, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to answer the research question. The steps followed include:

## Data Visualization:

Line Chart: Visualizes the electricity costs over time, with a highlighted period regarding the pandemic and the annotated peaks and lowest point in costs. 

Bar Charts: One bar chart is a faceted bar chart to compare the amount of energy consumed across all boroughs during various phases of the pandemic, such as pre-COVID/Before, during COVID, and post-COVID/After. The other bar chart depicts the change in the percentage of electricity consumption by borough across the period of COVID/the pandemic.
